        If you are not familiar, Python is a high-level programming language, and the syntax is easy to understand and read. In fact, Python reads a lot like English!
        Also, Python Crash Course helps you build your first projects for your developer portfolio. Thus, you will practice your problem-solving skills as you learn how to think like a programmer.
        Python is highly versatile. You can use it for both small and complex tasks, and it is used across many different industries from its more common applications in data science and software engineering to environments like mobile app development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

  When you’re learning a new programming language — particularly after you’ve completed your bootcamp course or degree — you’ll want to feel confident that you have a community of programmers you can turn to with questions when an issue comes up. One major benefit of Python is its robust and supportive online community, as evidenced by the 1.5 Million GitHub repositories that make Python the platform’s second-largest community.

<header class = 'hero'>
<h1> <span style = "color:var(--primary-color);">Where can I use Python???</span></h1>

</header>
<ul>
    <li>
        Web Development
    </li>
    <li>
        Data Science
    </li>
    <li>
        App Development
    </li>
</ul>
And as we say Python is fun, expressive, its readable style, quick editing, run development cycle meaning you can sit down writing code, rather than fighting compilers and complex syntax. Python will grow with you as your experiments become prototypes, your prototypes become products.
